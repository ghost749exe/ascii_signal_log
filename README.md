# ASCII Signal Log

**Repository Purpose:**  
The `ascii_signal_log` repository contains a series of archived diagnostic logs, metadata schemas, and legacy system references collected during a multi-phase indexing operation.

All contents are text-based, designed for broad compatibility across parsing systems.

## Directory Structure

- `/seed_packets/`  
  Legacy fragments and initialization routines. Includes early drift signal captures.

- `/meta/`  
  Structured metadata. Contains vector indexes and deprecated financial modeling indicators.

- `/echo/`  
  Archived logs from past memory traces. These were left untouched for version fidelity.

- `/sigil/`  
  Symbolic and encoded reference charts. Used for visual validation or testing symbolic parsers.

- `/vault/`  
  End-of-chain memory drops and lock-level data. For archival use only.
